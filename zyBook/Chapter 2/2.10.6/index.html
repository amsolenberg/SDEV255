<!-- Registering event handler using addEventListener() -->

<!-- The JavaScript code registers mouseover and mouseout event handlers for all elements that use the highlight class. 
Create and register a JavaScript event handler called myClickHandler() to handle click events for the same elements. 
The myClickHandler() function should reveal the hidden text by changing the style.color of the event.target to "black". -->

              Event handlers are also known as
              <span class="highlight hide">callback functions</span>,
              because the handlers are "called back" when the appropriate event happens.

              Event-driven programming allows webpages to react to
              <span class="highlight hide">user actions</span> and
              <span class="highlight hide">web server actions</span>.
