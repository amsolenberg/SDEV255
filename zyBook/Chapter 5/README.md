| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `=`        | Compares two values for equality            | `1 = 2` is false           |
| `!=`       | Compares two values for inequality          | `1 != 2` is true           |
| `<`        | Compares two values with <                  | `2 < 2` is false           |
| `<=`       | Compares two values with ≤                  | `2 <= 2` is true           |
| `>`        | Compares two values with >                  | `3 > 3` is false           |
| `>=`       | Compares two values with ≥                  | `3 >= 3` is true           |
| `AND`      | Performs logical AND between two conditions | `1 > 2 AND 2 < 3` is false |
| `OR`       | Performs logical OR between two conditions  | `1 > 2 OR 2 < 3` is true   |
| `NOT`      | Negates a condition                         | `NOT 1 > 2` is true        |
